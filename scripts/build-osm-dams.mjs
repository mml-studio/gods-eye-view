 *
 * WHY THE WORLD OUTSIDE FRANCE IS NOT RE-EXTRACTED
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * The pack was, until this script existed, 704 features for the entire planet,
 * decoded out of an Open Infrastructure Map POWER-PLANT layer that had been
 * filtered on a dam tag — 44 of them in France. A France fork therefore shipped
 * a "Barrages" row that lit up on nothing. France is now extracted directly and
 * completely; the rest of the world is CARRIED OVER from that old snapshot,
 * feature for feature, because re-extracting `waterway=dam` worldwide is tens of
 * megabytes of committed geometry for a fork whose subject is France. What the
 * layer claims is set accordingly: `coverage: 'fr'` in the taxonomy.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCE
 * -----------
 * The world half is read back out of the file this script writes, so running it
 * twice is a no-op on that half:
 *   - a carried-over feature already in the shipped shape passes through byte
 *     for byte;
 *   - a feature still in the legacy `{name, tags, osm_id}` shape is migrated
 *     through `damFeatureProperties` on the way past (this happens exactly once,
 *     on the first run against the old file);
 *   - a carried-over feature whose OSM id is in the fresh French extraction is
 *     DROPPED, because the fresh one supersedes it. Id and not proximity: the
 *     old snapshot's geometry is the power station's outline, not the dam's, so
 *     the two centroids can sit 300 m apart while being the same OSM object.
 *
 * DETERMINISM
 * -----------
 * Features are emitted in code-point order of their compact OSM id (never
 * `localeCompare`, whose collation depends on the runtime's ICU build), and
 * coordinates are rounded to 6 decimals (~11 cm). Two runs over the same
 * Overpass answer produce the same bytes on any machine, so the committed
 * file's diff shows what OSM actually changed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/build-osm-dams.mjs                  # queries Overpass
 *   node scripts/build-osm-dams.mjs ./raw-fr.json    # reads a saved answer
