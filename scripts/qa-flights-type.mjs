/**
 * qa-flights-type — phase 3a: "Type not reported", and what the adapter was
 * throwing away.
 *
 * OpenSky `/states/all` carries no ICAO type designator at all — only an
 * emitter category at index 17, which the 2026-07-02 field survey recorded as
 * `0`/"no info" for ~94 % of contacts (flights.js, the ambient-enrichment
 * comment). The type answer therefore arrived only through a rationed adsbdb
 * lookup (4 in flight, a 300-token bucket) that most of a busy region never
 * won. That much was known.
 *
 * What was NOT known is that the civil layer's fallback source already had the
 * answer in hand. adsb.lol publishes `t` (type designator) and `r` (tail) on
 * every record, and `adsbLolFallback.js` copied neither — it forwarded the
 * emitter category and dropped the two fields the classifier actually wants.
 *
 * So this harness measures the fallback path on LIVE upstream data, through
 * the shipped adapter, and counts. It does not look at pixels: there is no way
 * to force a browser session into fallback mode on demand, and the claim under
 * test is arithmetic anyway.
 *
 *  A. THE FIELDS ARE REALLY THERE. Share of contacts whose normalized vector
 *     carries a type designator at [18] and a tail at [19]. Measured
 *     2026-09-03 over Paris + Los Angeles, 1 447 contacts: 95.9 % and 96.8 %.
 *
 *  B. THE VECTOR SURVIVES THE PROXY. Indices 18/19 are a GEV extension past
 *     OpenSky's 18 entries, and the proxy JSON-stringifies the vector before
 *     the client reads it by index. Every row must be 20 long on both sides of
 *     a serialization round-trip — `undefined` would silently vanish.
 *
 *  C. THE CORRECTION IS MOSTLY NOT ABOUT `unknown`. This is the check worth
 *     reading. adsb.lol populates the emitter category far better than OpenSky
 *     does, so the placeholder silhouette was never the main damage here: the
 *     coarse category maps A2/A3 onto 'light'/'airliner', which drew business
 *     jets as narrow-bodies and turboprops as jets. Count the contacts whose
 *     class CHANGES once the designator is read, and separate the ones that
 *     were merely unclassified from the ones that were classified WRONG.
 *     Measured 2026-09-03: 282 of 1 447 changed (19.5 %), of which 244 were a
 *     wrong silhouette rather than a placeholder — 95 business jets drawn as
 *     narrow-bodies, 39 turboprops drawn as light aircraft.
 *
 *  D. THE PLACEHOLDER BUCKET STILL SHRINKS. Strictly fewer `unknown` contacts
 *     after than before. Measured 2026-09-03: 69 (4.8 %) -> 31 (2.1 %).
 *
 *  E. A TAIL IS NOT A CALLSIGN. The adapter used to fill the callsign slot with
 *     `r` when `flight` was blank, so `mapAnalystRecord` published a
 *     registration as a spoken callsign. For every contact that reports a tail
 *     and no callsign, vector[1] must now be null — the label chain does that
 *     fallback one layer up, where it knows which field it is reading.
 *
 *  F. THE LEGEND IS IN FRENCH. The other half of the phase. `unknown` must be
 *     worded exactly as the sea layers word it.
 *
 * NEEDS THE NETWORK: it calls api.adsb.lol directly, with the same URL, radius
 * and User-Agent the dev-server proxy uses. An unreachable upstream is reported
 * as "not testable here", not as a failure.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/qa-flights-type.mjs
