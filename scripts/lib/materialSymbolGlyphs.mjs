/**
 * Which Material Symbols glyphs this app actually renders.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The icon font shipped whole: 323 kB of variable font
 * for the couple of dozen glyphs on screen, fetched from `fonts.gstatic.com`
 * on every cold boot, blocking the first paint. Subsetting it is worth more
 * than every other font saving combined — and it is the one change here that
 * can break the interface SILENTLY, because a glyph the subset does not carry
 * does not fall back to a box: the ligature never forms and the element
 * renders the literal word `right_panel_open` in the middle of the cockpit.
 *
 * So the glyph list is not maintained by hand. It is extracted from the
 * sources, checked against Google's own codepoint list, and pinned by
 * `src/materialSymbolsSubset.test.mjs`, which fails `npm test` the moment a
 * source file names a glyph the committed subset does not carry. Adding an
 * icon is then: use it, run `npm run icons:subset`, commit the font.
 *
 * WHAT IT MATCHES, AND WHY IT ERRS WIDE. Two patterns:
 *
 *   A. the glyph as element text — `<span class="material-symbols-outlined">
 *      radar</span>` — in HTML and in the template literals that build markup;
 *   B. ANY string literal assigned to `textContent`/`innerText` that is a real
 *      Material Symbols name.
 *
 * B is deliberately loose. The tight version — "only when the element is
 * demonstrably a symbols span" — is the one that missed
 * `icon.textContent = expanded ? 'right_panel_close' : 'right_panel_open'`
 * during the first pass of this work: the class is set on one line, the glyph
 * chosen in a ternary forty lines away. Following that statically is a
 * data-flow analysis; being wrong costs a broken cockpit. Being wide costs a
 * few hundred bytes per unnecessary glyph, and the validation against the
 * official codepoint list keeps ordinary English strings out of the list —
 * only words Google actually named an icon after can get in.
 *
 * B reads the whole statement, up to the `;`, ACROSS LINES: the same ternary
 * formatted over three lines used to be read down to the first newline only,
 * so the two glyphs it chooses between were never seen. Nothing in the tree
 * was formatted that way when this was widened, which is the point — the hole
 * was empty, not absent.
 *
 * What sits to the LEFT of a `?` is the condition, not the text being shown,
 * so it is dropped: `status === 'error' ? …` enrolled `error`, a real icon
 * name that no source ever draws, and the subset carried it for nothing.
 * Optional chaining is neutralised first — `payload?.status` is not a ternary.
