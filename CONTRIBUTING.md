# Contributing to Surplomb

Thanks for being here. Surplomb is an open foundation for live spatial intelligence in the browser, and it gets better when more people run it, break it, and extend it.

## Getting set up

Use Node.js 24.14.x or 26.x (also enforced by `package.json`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mml-studio/surplomb.git
cd surplomb
nvm install 24.14.0
nvm use 24.14.0
npm install
./scripts/dev-fresh.sh        # or: GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="…" npm run dev
```

You need a **Google Maps API key** with the Map Tiles API enabled (see the [README](README.md#-api-keys)). Most data layers work with no other accounts. On macOS the launcher pulls keys from the Keychain; on any platform you can pass them as env vars or use a `.env` (copy `.env.example`).

Open `http://localhost:4173`. Before sending a PR run `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:track` (dev server must be up) — **all three must stay green.**

## Good first contributions

The highest-leverage places to jump in:

- **🌆 Add a CCTV source pack.** Austin is the reference camera source. Adding another city means a clean public camera catalog with coordinates, attribution, and server-registered frame URLs (the proxy only fetches registered URLs — never client-supplied ones, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). City packs are the best first lane.
- **🔌 Plug a dataset — one JSON file, no code.** Drop a manifest in `datasets/<id>.json` (or paste the dataset's address into **＋ BRANCHER UN JEU DE DONNÉES** under the layer list and copy the manifest it produces) and the layer is on the panel at the next build: group, source line, credit, card and legend derive from the file. `npm run dataset:manifest -- <url>` writes one from a data.gouv.fr page, an Opendatasoft page, a WFS or a bare GeoJSON/CSV. Contract and limits: [`docs/DATASETS.md`](docs/DATASETS.md).
- **🛰️ Add or improve a data layer.** Each layer is one self-contained module in `src/data/<layer>.js` implementing the layer interface (`init/enable/disable/update/destroy/getStats`, optional `getDetectableObjects`/`getStats`). Use an existing layer as a template.
- **🎙️ Extend voice control.** Voice tools are declared server-side (`GEV_REALTIME_TOOLS` in `vite.config.js`) and executed client-side (`src/voice/gevActions.js`). Keep the tool surface tight and the responses honest (confirm only what actually happened).
- **🎨 Add a visual style.** Styles are GLSL post-process shaders in `src/styles/`.
- **🐛 Fix bugs / improve the first-run experience.** See [docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md).

## Finding a French data source (`.mcp.json`)

`.mcp.json` registers the **official data.gouv.fr MCP server** (`https://mcp.data.gouv.fr/mcp`, no key, read-only) so a compatible AI assistant can search the national open-data catalog while you work. It's a discovery aid for authors — `search_datasets`, `search_dataservices`, `get_dataservice_openapi_spec` and `list_dataset_resources` beat guessing at dataset URLs when you're scoping a new layer.

The step after a hit is one command. The dataset id or resource id the MCP returns is exactly what the manifest tool opens:

```
search_datasets("défibrillateurs")                         # MCP → dataset 61556e1e9d6adb2df86eb0fc
list_dataset_resources("61556e1e9d6adb2df86eb0fc")         # MCP → the CSV resource
npm run dataset:manifest -- 61556e1e9d6adb2df86eb0fc       # writes datasets/<id>.json
```

The tool reads the same REST endpoints the MCP wraps, profiles the columns on the Tabular API, guesses the geometry and says why, and reminds you that the licence it read is confirmed on the dataset's page. See [`docs/DATASETS.md`](docs/DATASETS.md).

It is **not** a runtime data path, and no product code should call it:

- Its CORS preflight answers `403` — the browser can't reach it.
- Its tools return prose for a model to read, not typed JSON. The plain REST API (`https://www.data.gouv.fr/api/2/datasets/resources/<id>/`) returns real fields and is what layers and scripts should use.
- data.gouv.fr call the server experimental and warn its answers "peuvent être incomplètes, erronées ou inclure des hallucinations", recommending their APIs for anything serious.

Layers already fetch the same platform directly: 162 pinned `www.data.gouv.fr/api/1/datasets/r/<uuid>` resources, mostly the national transport access point's GTFS feeds in `config/pan_gtfs_*.json`.

⚠️ **Never source a licence claim from an MCP answer.** Use it to find a candidate; confirm the licence and attribution on the dataset's own page before it goes into [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md).

## Architecture in one minute

- **No framework.** Vanilla JS + [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- **UI lives in `src/ui.js`** (panels, HUD, styles, the control facade). **Layer logic lives in `src/data/<layer>.js`.** Keep them separate.
- **Secrets stay server-side.** Anything needing a private key goes through a Vite proxy in `vite.config.js`. The browser only ever sees the Google Maps key (which you restrict) and ephemeral tokens.
- `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` is the authoritative runtime reference — read it first.

## QA harnesses (and the welcome card)

Every headless harness is a *fresh browser session*, and the first-run mission
card ([`src/firstRunExperience.js`](src/firstRunExperience.js)) returns on every
fresh session by design. Left alone it sits over the globe and swallows the
clicks, pixels, and focus a harness is trying to measure — the failure usually
looks like a broken layer, not like a modal.

So: **open the page with `newQaPage(browser)`**, never `browser.newPage()`.

```js
import { newQaPage } from './lib/qa-first-run.mjs';   // scripts/lib/qa-first-run.mjs

const page = await newQaPage(browser);                 // card already handled
```

`npm test` enforces this: [`src/qaFirstRunSuppression.test.mjs`](src/qaFirstRunSuppression.test.mjs)
audits every `scripts/qa-*.mjs` that navigates and fails with the fix in the
message. `firstRunLauncherSuppressed(page)` is there if a harness wants to
*prove* the card is out of its shot; `scripts/qa-firstrun.mjs` is the one
exemption, because the card is its subject.

**Testing by hand in a real browser?** Open
`http://localhost:4173/?welcome=0` — same suppression, nothing to click away.
(`?welcome=1` forces the card back when you do want to see it.)

## Coding style

- ES modules, **2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons.**
- JSDoc on exported/public functions.
- Match the surrounding code — comment density, naming, and idiom.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits. Conventional-commit-style prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:`) are appreciated but not required.

## Pull requests

1. Branch off `main`.
2. Keep `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:track` green and avoid new console errors.
3. If you change runtime behavior, update `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same PR.
4. If you add or change a data source, update [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md) with its license and attribution. **Don't add data you don't have the right to redistribute** — fetch it at runtime instead.
5. Describe what you changed and how you verified it (screenshots welcome for anything visual).

## Ground rules

- This is a tool for **public** data. Don't add scraping of sources whose terms forbid it, private/paywalled datasets, or anything that misrepresents public-data inference as authoritative intelligence.
- Be decent to each other. Assume good faith, keep it constructive.
