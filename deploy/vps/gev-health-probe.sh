# Déclassifié — availability probe.
#
# Answers one question the deploy timer cannot: is the page a reader would
# open actually answering? `gev-deploy.sh` knows the container was built and
# started; it learns nothing about the Cloudflare tunnel, DNS, an edge rule, or
# a process that came up and then wedged. Every outage on this deployment so
# far has been found by somebody looking at a screen.
#
# FROM THE VPS, NOT FROM A LAPTOP. The Cloudflare rule in front of this origin
# is per source address and Claude runs on the same public IP as the owner's
# browser: a probe from there rate-limits the person it was meant to protect.
# The box has its own address and is idle.
#
# Two targets, because they fail differently and the difference is the
# diagnosis:
#   origin  — http://127.0.0.1:4173/healthz, the container itself.
#   public  — https://<host>/healthz, through the tunnel and the edge.
# origin up + public down is a tunnel or DNS fault; both down is the app.
#
# /healthz is deliberately the target: it is the one route the Basic gate
# leaves open, so this needs no credential, and it echoes the address the
# in-app throttles will key a caller on — which is how the deployment checks
# that "per IP" is per IP and not one bucket for the whole tunnel.
#
# Appends one line per run to $STATE/health.log and keeps the last N. Nothing
# alerts: this is the record you read AFTER someone says "it was down", so the
# answer is a timestamp instead of a shrug.
