# Surplomb — VPS deploy agent.
#
# Runs on a timer, decides which ref should be on the staging URL, and
# rebuilds only when that ref's commit changed. The default target is "auto":
# the most recently updated OPEN pull request, falling back to main when there
# is none — so opening a PR is all it takes for the staging URL to show it.
#
#   echo auto           > /opt/gev/target   # newest open PR, else main
#   echo main           > /opt/gev/target   # pin to main
#   echo my-branch      > /opt/gev/target   # pin to a branch
#
# WHAT IS SERVED ALWAYS CONTAINS MAIN (since 2026-09-10). "Newest open PR" on
# its own says nothing about merged work: a branch cut before two PRs landed
# keeps serving the tree it was cut from, so the URL shows a fork that is HOURS
# behind its own main and nothing on the box says why. Measured that day — PR
# #155, cut at #152, held #153 and #154 off the URL twenty minutes after they
# were merged. So `auto` now takes the newest open PR only while that branch is
# not behind main, and shows main itself otherwise. A preview is a superset of
# main or it is not shown; the reason is written to state/selection either way.
#
# An explicit pin is an explicit choice and is never overridden — but a pinned
# branch that has fallen behind main says so in the log and in state/selection,
# because "staging is pinned to something stale" is the other way this URL has
# lied about the repository.
#
# Deliberately pull-based: GitHub never needs a route into the VPS, and the
# box holds no CI credentials. The repo is public, so no token either.
#
# That last property is why the source arrives as a TARBALL rather than a
# clone. GitHub answers this box's anonymous ref advertisement (a GET) with
# 200 but returns 401 to POST /git-upload-pack, and every pack transfer goes
# through that POST — so `git clone` and `git fetch` cannot run here at all,
# under any protocol version. codeload is a plain GET and needs no credential.
# Listing a ref still works over git, but only in protocol v0, which does not
# POST; the v2 default cannot even resolve a branch head from this IP.
