// The property under test is the one thing this adapter adds to the shared
// thinning policy: **no family may be squeezed off the map by a bigger one.**
// The families differ by a factor of 13.7 nationally (30 215 médecins against
// 2 211 hôpitaux), so a single proportional pass gives the rarest family a
// dozen dots for a whole country. Every test here is a door that erasure could
// come back through — the allocation, the floor, the reconciliation to exactly
// the budget, and the per-family report the legend prints.
//
// The second property is that the thinning is REPORTED. A maillage that does
// not hand back both numbers per family lets the layer claim the sample is the
// inventory.
