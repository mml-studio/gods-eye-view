/**
 * lazyLayer.js — a data layer that costs nothing until someone switches it on.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `main.js` used to import all 60 data layers statically, so
 * every one of them landed in the entry chunk: measured on 2026-09-09 with
 * rollup's own module graph, those 60 roots pulled 4 798 kB of the entry's
 * 7 278 kB pre-minification — 66% of the JavaScript a visitor parses before the
 * globe appears, for layers that are all OFF at boot. A reader who opens the
 * app and looks at Paris pays for the CCTV camera model, the AIS vessel
 * decoder, the satellite propagator and 57 others, and switches on none.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. A stub that satisfies the `DataLayerManager` layer contract
 * with nothing behind it, plus a `load()` that fetches the real module on
 * first use. The manager is untouched: it registers, draws and seals these
 * exactly as before, because the stub answers every question the manager asks
 * of a layer that is OFF, and hands the rest to the module the moment one
 * exists.
 *
 * THE SEAM IS `init()`. The manager calls it once, before `enable()`, and only
 * for a layer being turned on — see `_doToggle()`. So `init()` is where the
 * dynamic import is awaited. Everything the manager can legitimately call
 * BEFORE that point is enumerated in `LAZY_LAYER_CAPABILITIES` below and
 * answered here without a fetch; everything else does not exist on the stub at
 * all, which is the same answer a `typeof layer.x === 'function'` guard got
 * from a layer that was off.
 */

/**
 * The optional layer methods a caller can reach BEFORE the module is loaded.
 *
 * This list is not decorative: `DataLayerManager` decides what a layer
 * SUPPORTS by probing for these (`typeof entry.module.setParams === 'function'`
 * in `_reserveLayerParamsIntent`, and four more like it). A stub that exposed
 * `setParams` for a layer that has none would make the manager accept a
 * parameter intent it should have refused, so presence has to mirror the real
 * module exactly — which is what `layerManifest.test.mjs` proves, per layer,
 * by loading every module and comparing.
 *
 * Everything NOT in this list — `getRowControls`, `trackById`, `selectCamera`,
 * the seventy-odd methods layers publish for the UI and the voice actions —
 * appears on the stub only after `adopt()`. Those callers all reach a layer
 * through `dataManager.layers.get(id)?.module` and all guard on the method
 * being a function, and none of them has anything to say to a layer that is
 * off, so "absent until loaded" is the honest answer rather than a regression.
