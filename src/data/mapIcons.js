/**
 * @module mapIcons
 *
 * The CC0 **map** icon sets — Maki and Temaki — vendored path by path, and the
 * one renderer that draws them the way this project draws every other glyph.
 *
 * ── WHY A SECOND SET AT ALL, NEXT TO MATERIAL SYMBOLS ───────────────────────
 *
 * `transitVehicleIcons.js` and `sharedMobilityIcons.js` already vendor Google's
 * Material Symbols and both record the same finding: recognition beats
 * invention. Nothing here contradicts that. What it adds is a distinction those
 * two modules never had to make, because a bus and a bicycle happen to be
 * things a UI icon set draws well.
 *
 * Material Symbols is an **interface** set. It is drawn for ~24 px inside a
 * menu, where a reader is looking straight at it against a flat background.
 * Maki (Mapbox) and Temaki (the OpenStreetMap iD editor) are **cartographic**
 * sets: authored in a 15-unit box, for a label sitting on top of imagery, at
 * the size a marker actually occupies on a map. That is our size band — the
 * layers here draw at 15 to 29 CSS px over an orthophoto — and it is the band
 * where Material's interface glyphs start to fail. Two of them measurably do;
 * see the substitutions recorded at each call site.
 *
 * So this is not a migration. Material keeps everything it draws well, which is
 * most of the fleet. This module exists for the cases where a set built for
 * maps wins, and for the subjects Material simply has no glyph for.
 *
 * ── LICENCE: CC0, WHICH IS WHY THIS FILE CAN BE SHORT ───────────────────────
 *
 * Both sets are CC0 1.0 — a public-domain dedication, not a licence with
 * conditions. There is no attribution obligation, no notice to propagate, and
 * no "state your changes" clause of the kind Apache-2.0 §4 imposes on the
 * Material artwork.
 *
 * `licenses/maki/` and `licenses/temaki/` carry the upstream texts and a NOTICE
 * anyway. Recording where artwork came from is this project's own discipline —
 * the same reason `DATA_SOURCES.md` exists for the feeds — and it is what lets
 * a reader audit the claim below without cloning two repositories.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS TAKEN, AND WHAT WAS CHANGED ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Only the `d` string of each path, verbatim, in each set's own 15-unit box.
 * The coordinates are NOT rescaled, for the reason the Material notice already
 * gives: rescaling is a redraw, and a redraw is no longer the artwork that was
 * evaluated.
 *
 * One mechanical normalisation, and it changes no coordinate: Maki's published
 * SVG breaks long `d` attributes with XML character escapes (`&#xA;&#x9;` —
 * newline plus tab). Those are whitespace to an SVG path parser, and they are
 * resolved to single spaces here so the string can live in JavaScript source.
 * Every number, command letter and their order are untouched.
 *
 * ── TINT-SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION, LIKE ITS TWO SIBLING PACKS ───────────────────
 *
 * One geometry, two passes: a wide dark stroke first, the white artwork second.
 * Cesium multiplies `billboard.color` into the texture, so white takes the
 * layer's colour exactly while black survives the multiply (0 × c = 0) and
 * keeps the glyph readable over pale terrain.
 *
 * This is not a style preference, and `cctv.js` is the proof. Its camera used
 * to be drawn with cyan baked into the artwork while the layer tinted the
 * billboard amber to mark the ACTIVE camera. #75e7ff × #ffd97a = **#75c57a** —
 * the one camera the operator had selected rendered green. White artwork makes
 * that multiply an identity, so the selected camera is the amber the layer asked
 * for. A baked hue is a bug, not a look.
 */

/**
 * The authoring box most of both sets use, padded by one unit on every side.
 *
 * Maki and Temaki mostly author to `0 0 15 15` and both draw right up to the
 * edges — Temaki's camera starts at x=0 and ends at x=15. The halo pass strokes
 * that same geometry OUTWARD, so at the published viewBox roughly half the halo
 * would fall outside the canvas and be clipped, leaving a glyph with a dark
 * outline on three sides and a bare white edge on the fourth.
 *
 * Padding the viewBox is not a modification of the artwork: no path coordinate
 * moves, the canvas around them simply grows. The 15-unit glyph then occupies
 * 15/17 ≈ 88% of the raster, which also happens to match how much of its own
 * 960 box a Material Symbol typically fills — so the two sets land at the same
 * optical weight when they sit on the same globe.

 * here rather than rescaled into 15 units for the reason this module's header
 * gives — rescaling is a redraw, and a redraw is no longer the artwork that was
 * evaluated. Everything downstream (viewBox, halo width, the plate composition
