// src/data/provisionalFloor.js — provisional rendered-surface ground floors
// (field finding 2026-09-10, generalised from `fireAnchors.js` 2026-09-10).
//
// WHY THE DEM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. `groundFloor.js` resolves a point's floor
// over the NETWORK, and until it answers a sprite anchored on it sits at
// ellipsoid 0 — hundreds of metres under its own ground. Every layer that
// draws with `disableDepthTestDistance` still PAINTS such a sprite (that flag
// exists so a marker is not swallowed by the kerb it stands on), and a sprite
// that is not on the ground has a screen position that is a function of the
// CAMERA POSE. Drag the map and the marks slide across the landscape, then
// jump into place when the DEM lands. It recurs on every patch of ground a
// session has not visited yet — which is exactly the ground someone panning
// around is looking at.
//
// Measured over the Chiapas fires: every sprite in view spent its first
// ~0.5-1 s at height 0 and then jumped to 293.2 m.
//
// The fix is to place a point on the surface being DRAWN under it from its
// first frame. `scene.sampleHeight` reads that surface directly (the photoreal
// mesh in the google-3d regime), synchronously, with no network of our own —
// and the DEM refines each anchor to its own cell when it lands (measured
// agreement between the two: mesh - DEM = +1.2 m mean over nine points of
// Landes pine forest, -1.3 m at Bordeaux).
//
// WHY THIS DOES NOT GO THROUGH `meshFloorSampler.js`. That module feeds the
// SHARED floor cache, and it refuses to latch a sample without a real DEM
// prior to check it against — a rule bought with a measurement (a coarse-LOD
// probe read 20.6 m for ground that is really ~122 m, and the one-shot latch
// made it permanent). The cold case here is precisely "no prior yet", so
// nothing this store holds is allowed anywhere near that cache: it is
// provisional, it is always overridden by the DEM, and every entry records
// what it could see when it was taken so a later pass can improve on it.
//
// ONE STORE, KEYED BY CELL, SHARED BY EVERY CALLER. A ~111 m cell of ground is
// the same ground whichever layer asked about it, so a probe paid for by the
// fires is read for free by the shared vehicles parked on the same street.
// Callers differ only in the three knobs `sampleProvisionalFloors` takes.
