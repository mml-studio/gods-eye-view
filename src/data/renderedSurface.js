/**
 * The height of the surface this app is ACTUALLY DRAWING at a coordinate —
 * under either map stack, not just the one where the globe is visible.
 *
 * ── The half-fix this module completes ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `addressScanLayer.js` already records why a marker has to be seated by hand:
 * `Cartesian3.fromDegrees(lon, lat)` puts it on the ELLIPSOID, tens of metres
 * under the street it describes, and because depth testing is disabled it is
 * still painted — just in the wrong place, sliding over the city as the camera
 * moves. That header is right, and the mechanism it describes reads
 * `globe.getHeight()`.
 *
 * `globe.getHeight()` answers from the terrain tiles the GLOBE has resident.
 * `main.js:215` sets `globe.show = keylessMode`, and `mapStackController.js:727`
 * hides it whenever the photorealistic stack is active — which is the DEFAULT
 * stack for anyone with a key. A hidden globe streams no tiles, so `getHeight`
 * returns `undefined` for every point, every seating pass is a no-op, and the
 * bug the seating exists to fix is fully present on the stack most readers are
 * looking at. Nothing throws and nothing logs; `seatPending` simply stays true
 * forever.
 *
 * MEASURED in the running app, 2026-09-10, Latin Quarter, camera nadir at
 * 420 m over Cardinal Lemoine, canvas 1400 × 900:
 *
 *   - every `idfm-network` stop drawn at ellipsoidal height 0.0 m, while
 *     `scene.sampleHeight` reads the rendered Google mesh under those same
 *     coordinates at **83.5 to 91.6 m**;
 *   - median on-screen error **140 px**, worst **272 px** — a stop marker
 *     landing two blocks from the stop;
 *   - a 250 m sideways pan slides a mark **up to 269 px** across the ground it
 *     is supposed to be nailed to. That is the reported symptom, exactly.
 *
 * ── What answers on the photoreal stack, and what it costs ──────────────────
 * `scene.sampleHeight()` reads the rendered geometry — the tileset skin — and
 * is the only thing that can answer when the globe is hidden. It is NOT free:
 * it forces a synchronous offscreen pick render. Measured on the same run,
 * headless SwiftShader: **6.28 ms per call**, 15 of 15 hits. That is the same
 * cost class `meshFloorSampler.js` and `groundSnap.js` already ration, and for
 * the same reason — it must never be called per frame, and never once per
 * marker without a budget.
 *
 * ── Two tiers, because the first one is 95 % of the win for 1/60th the cost ─
 * Over that whole viewport the mesh spanned 83.5 → 91.6 m: **8.1 m** of relief
 * across the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, one of the steepest things inside the
 * Paris boulevards. So:
 *
 *   TIER 1 — ONE probe at the scan centre, spent on every scan, and handed to
 *   every marker in the box as its fallback. It converts an 85 m error into an
 *   8 m one, i.e. 272 px into ~13 px, for a single 6 ms call.
 *
 *   TIER 2 — a per-marker probe, budgeted at {@link SURFACE_SAMPLE_BUDGET} per
 *   pass and latched one-shot per marker, spent over the settle passes that
 *   follow. It removes the residual relief.
 *
 * A marker that has had its own reading is remembered in a WeakSet rather than
 * on a flag, so a re-scan that discards its entities discards the memory with
 * them and nothing has to be invalidated by hand.
 *
 * ── Its relation to `provisionalFloor.js`, which owns the same question ─────
 * PR #145 fixed this defect for the FIRMS detections and PR #150 extracted the
 * result into `provisionalFloor.js`, the shared store the layers that draw a
 * mark on cold ground read. Nothing that module already decided is decided
 * again here: {@link SURFACE_MIN_M}, {@link SURFACE_MAX_M} and
 * {@link SURFACE_MAX_CAMERA_HEIGHT_M} are ITS constants re-exported under this
 * module's own names, and the tiles-drained test both use belongs to
 * `meshFloorSampler.js`.
 *
 * What is NOT shared is the GRAIN, and that is the whole reason this file
 * exists rather than a call into that one. The store is keyed by ~111 m cell
 * and probes each cell at its CENTRE, which is right for a fire front
 * kilometres across and wrong for a stop: inside the boulevards a cell centre
 * lands on a ROOF as readily as on the pavement, and the photoreal mesh makes
 * no distinction — a probe that hits a Haussmannian roof answers twenty metres
 * high, and the one-shot latch would make that permanent under the stop. The
 * probe here is at the mark's OWN coordinate.
 *
 * The second difference is what is returned. That module answers a HEIGHT per
 * cell; this seats Cesium entities AND `PointPrimitive`s in place, which is
 * what `idfmNetwork.js` needs — it draws a billboard and a disc on every stop —
 * and what a height call cannot express on a primitive collection.
 *
 * ── Why not `HeightReference.CLAMP_TO_3D_TILE` ──────────────────────────────
 * Cesium 1.138 has it, and for a billboard it would be the native answer. Two
 * things rule it out as THE mechanism here. `addressScanLayer.js` measured
 * `CLAMP_TO_GROUND` making markers unpickable in this app — 30 points drawn,
 * `scene.pick` returning null at their own screen coordinate — and a stop you
 * cannot click is a worse defect than a stop drawn 8 m off. And
 * `PointPrimitive` carries no `heightReference` at all, so the frequency disc
 * collection could not use it even if the billboards over it could. One
 * mechanism that serves both beats two that each serve half. The 3D-tile
 * clamp also wants `tileset.enableCollision` and re-runs a height callback per
 * tile load, which is the wrong bill for a thousand static billboards.
