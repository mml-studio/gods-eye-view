/**
 * Shared pick-ownership registry for layers that install their own
 * ScreenSpaceEventHandler click handlers.
 *
 * Two questions live here, and both are about WHOSE click it is rather than
 * where it landed: {@link isOwnedByOtherLayer}, so a layer leaves a sibling's
 * marker alone, and {@link isWorldPick}, so a layer can still recognise a
 * click on the map itself now that the map is a 3D Tiles surface.
 *
 * {@link registerPickDecoration} serves the second of those: a layer declares
 * the geometry of its own that NOBODY can select, so a wash the size of a
 * commune stops reading as an object in front of the map.
 *
 * Problem solved: each entity layer (commercial flights, military flights)
 * receives every LEFT_CLICK. When the user clicks a military aircraft while
 * a commercial flight is tracked, the commercial handler used to classify
 * the pick as "empty space" and clear tracking (with a camera flight) at the
 * same moment the military handler started tracking — two competing camera
 * commands. Layers now register a predicate so siblings can recognize picks
 * that belong to someone else and leave them alone.

/**
 * Whether a pick is the WORLD rather than an object somebody could select.
 *
 * ── The bug this exists to end, and it shipped in four places ─────────────
 * Before the photorealistic globe, "the reader clicked the map" was
 * `!picked` — `scene.pick` answers nothing for the bare globe, which is not a
 * primitive. With a 3D Tiles surface under the cursor that stopped being true,
 * and the layers that had written `if (!picked) clearSelection()` quietly lost
 * the ability to close their own cards: measured 2026-09-10 over Paris at
 * 700 m with 470 tiles of content ready, **six probes across the screen, six
 * non-falsy picks**, each a plain pick object whose `primitive` is the
 * `Cesium3DTileset` and whose `id` — and whose `primitive.id` — is `undefined`.
 *
 * That last detail is the whole test. A tile feature carries NO id, so it can
 * never be claimed by a `registerPickOwner` predicate and can never be
 * selected by anybody; `resolvePickId` already answers `null` for it, exactly
 * as it does for the empty pick. So "nobody could own this" is the durable
 * statement, and it holds for the bare globe, for terrain, and for the
 * photoreal tileset alike — while `!picked` was a statement about which
 * SURFACE happened to be switched on.
 *
 * `localGeojson.js` reached this conclusion first and wrote it in a comment
 * next to its own handler; it is here so the next handler inherits it instead
 * of rediscovering it.
 *
 * ── AND A THIRD SURFACE THAT NOBODY CAN SELECT: THE DECORATIONS ───────────
 * The test above reads "carries no pick id", which is a proxy for "nobody
 * could own this" and not the statement itself. A ground-classified WASH
 * breaks the proxy: it is built by the Entity API, so it carries the entity's
 * id, and it is pickable — `delinquanceFrance.js` selects a commune by
 * clicking exactly that kind of fill. A wash that is decoration rather than
 * object therefore has to say so, or a layer that tints a whole commune makes
 * every sibling's ground click and every card dismissal inside that commune
 * resolve to `ignore`. See {@link registerPickDecoration}.
 *
 * @param {object|null|undefined} picked - Result of `scene.pick()`.
 * @returns {boolean} True for the empty pick, for anything with no pick id,
 *   and for geometry a layer has declared unselectable.
