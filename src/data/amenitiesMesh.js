/**
 * @module amenitiesMesh
 *
 * The middle regime of the everyday-amenities layer: the zooms between "all of
 * France" and "one street", where neither 96 painted départements nor 95 406
 * overlapping dots is the honest answer.
 *
 * The thinning policy itself lives in `geoMeshThinning.js` — `irveMesh.js`
 * worked it out, `schoolsMesh.js` and `anfrMesh.js` adopted it — and this file
 * is the amenities adapter. It differs from its three predecessors in exactly
 * one way, and that difference is the reason it is not a nine-line wrapper.
 *
 * ── Why this layer thins per FAMILY and its neighbours thin once ────────────
 * `schools-fr` thins 68 158 schools whose five levels are within a factor of
 * ten of each other. This set is not like that. Measured on the real pack:
 *
 *   médecin      30 215 dots        piscine       3 625
 *   courses      19 354             gendarmerie   3 953
 *   pharmacie    19 216             hôpital       2 211
 *   poste        16 832
 *
 * — a factor of **13.7** between the largest family and the smallest. A single
 * pass over the whole set spends its budget roughly in proportion to that mix,
 * which is defensible for a quantity and indefensible for this one: the whole
 * question a reader brings to this layer is *where is the nearest one*, and the
 * families they are least likely to find by accident are exactly the ones a
 * proportional sample erases.
 *
 * Measured at the national view (41.3–51.1 N, −5.2–9.6 E, 95 406 tuples, budget
 * 1 100 — the tier the national zoom actually uses):
 *
 *   one global pass    médecin 414 · courses 179 · pharmacie 139 · poste 284 ·
 *                      piscine 25 · gendarmerie 45 · hôpital 14
 *   per-family passes  médecin 331 · courses 223 · pharmacie 222 · poste 197 ·
 *                      piscine 42 · gendarmerie 46 · hôpital 39
 *
 * Fourteen hospitals for a country that has 2 211 of them is not a sample, it
 * is an absence with a decimal point. The floor rule below raises it to 39 and
 * pays for it out of the family that loses least by being sampled harder — the
 * global pass also happens to over-draw bureaux de poste (284 of 16 832)
 * against pharmacies (139 of 19 216), which is the cell-representative rule
 * reporting rural France accurately and reading as noise at this scale.
 *
 * ── The rule, stated so the distortion is legible ──────────────────────────
 * Each family gets its proportional share of the budget, but never less than
 * `budget / (4 × families present)` — 39 dots at the national tier, 78 at the
 * closest one — and never more than it actually has in view. What that buys is
 * a guarantee: **no family can be squeezed off the map by a bigger one.** What
 * it costs is that the on-screen mix is no longer the real mix, and that is a
 * distortion, so `amenitiesFrance.js` prints kept-against-in-view per family in
 * the legend. The picture is bent; the numbers next to it are not.
 *
 * ── The weight slot is the geocoding precision, and that is deliberate ──────
 * This point set has no magnitude. A pharmacy is one pharmacy; there is no roll
 * and no enrolment and no installed power, and inventing one would be the
 * layer's first lie. So the weight `geoMeshThinning.js` ranks by is the only
 * per-row quantity either register actually publishes: **how well the position
 * is known.** `cellRepresentative` therefore draws each cell with the example
 * whose coordinate the register is most confident about, which is the right dot
 * to keep when only one can be kept.
 *
 * Dependency-free and side-effect-free (no Cesium, no DOM) so it runs
 * identically in the browser, in the Vite dev-server proxy, and under
 * `node --test`.
